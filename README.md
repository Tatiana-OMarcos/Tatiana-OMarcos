Hello there! 👋
I'm Tatiana and I'm Web/Software Developer.
🔭 I’m currently immersed in a Java Project
👩‍💻 Recently diving into Kotlin.
🔍 I'm actively seeking opportunities to collaborate on open-source projects. 
🤔 While I'm confident in my abilities, I'm always open to learning and growth. If you have any suggestions, recommendations, or helpful resources to share, I'd greatly appreciate it!
💬 Feel free to ask me about anything related to web development, software architecture, or best practices in coding.
